# Sensor for the Blind
### Description:<br />
This project is a sensor for the visually impaired and blind to navigate around. The aim is for blind people to wear the sensor on their wrists and ankles, allowing them to know when they are about to run into something. If you would like to see the full process of my jouney on this project, go to the gh-pages branch and click on the building_journey.md file.<br />

### How to Run This Project:<br />
First, install an Arduino IDE (this is where I downloaded mine from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). The files can then be downloaded and thirdEyeProject.ino can be run from there, but it must be paired with an Arduino microcontroller board and physical sensor to properly work.<br />

### Authors:<br />
#### Amisha Nambiar and Kevin Miller<br />
Amisha Nambiar and Kevin Miller authored servoMotor.ino, switchTest.ino, and thirdEyeProject.ino.<br />

### Files in This Repository:<br />
servoMotor.ino runs the sensor and outputs angles when an object is sensed.<br />
switchTest.ino makes sure the on and off switch is working correctly.<br />
thirdEyeProject.ino contains the code for the entire machine and will beep when the user is about to encounter something.<br />
