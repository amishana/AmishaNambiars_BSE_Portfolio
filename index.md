# Third Eye for the Visually Impaired
I am working on a third eye for the visually blind. It is a wearable piece of technology that uses sensors to notify the wearer if they are about to hit something. The user can pick between a buzz or vibration to notify them if they get within a few centimeters of an object so they know it is there and can avoid bumping into it.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone was to solder all the parts of my device onto a perf board. It was hard for me to make lines with the solder because it kept pooling in the holes of the perf board. I finished soldering it and attached it to a strip so that the device can be mobile and usuable. I also replaced one of the libraries to be compatible with the other, because previously, my buzzer library was interfering with a different buzzer library that was already written into the servo motor's library. Overall, I am glad I did this project because it is a useful and cool project to have done. Also, this project made me interested in engineering and curious to explore it further.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone is that I got my prototype working more accurately. Before, my prototype had a lot of wiring and coding issues that I needed to resolve. Some of the wires were connected to the incorrect pins so they were not recieving certain lines of the code. I also had to replace and import two new libraries because I was using an ESP 32 instead of an Aruino Mini. I replaced both the library for the buzzer code and for the servo motor code for special ones that work on ESPs. This got my prototype to be fully funcional.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was building the prototype for the third eye with all the necessary components and going over the code for the Arduino. For the prototype, I placed the ESP 32, which can download code from the Arduino IDE, near the center of the breadboard. I connected the sensor to the ESP 32 and on the other side created  two paths. This was for the switch, where the user can pick if they want to be notified through a vibration (using the servo motor) or through a buzz (using the buzzer). The ESP 32 also connects to the LED light, to turn it on when the machine is on. There is also a transistor connected to manage the current flowing through the machine. I also went through the code, and learned what each line contributes to the machine.
