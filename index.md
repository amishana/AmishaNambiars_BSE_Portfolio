# Third Eye for the Visually Impaired
I am working on a third eye for the visually blind. It is a wearable piece of technology that uses sensors to notify the wearer if they are about to hit something. The user can pick a buzz or vibration to notify them if they get within a few centimeters of an object so they know it is there and can avoid bumping into it.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is that I got my prototype working more accurately. Before, my prototype had a lot of wiring and coding issues that I needed to resolve. Some of the wires were connected to the incorrect pins so they were not recieving certain lines of the code. I also had to replace and import two new libraries because I was using an ESP 32 instead of an Aruino Mini. I replaced both the library for the buzzer code and for the servo motor code for special ones that work on ESPs. This got my prototype to be fully funcional.

# First Milestone


My first milestone was building the prototype for the third eye with all the necessary components and going over the code for the Arduino. For the prototype, I placed the ESP 32, which can download code from the Arduino IDE, near the center of the breadboard. I connected the sensor to the ESP 32 and on the other side created  two paths. This was for the switch, where the user can pick if they want to be notified through a vibration (using the servo motor) or through a buzz (using the buzzer). The ESP 32 also connects to the LED light, to turn it on when the machine is on. There is also a transistor connected to manage the current flowing through the machine. I also went through the code, and learned what each line contributes to the machine.
